# Random Password Generator

## Building a Password Generator

The purpose of this project is to created a random password generator. Developing this project demonstrates our programming skills.
This project was developed with javascript. It was important that the random password generator worked. I learnt that even if a project was pseudo coded before hand; it does not guarantee that everything was considered and to be open to some "trail and error".  

The following is an image of the password generator.
